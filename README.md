**Tencoin (TEC)** is a decentralized peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that combines Bitcoin's proven UTXO architecture with native consensus-enforced conditional transactions.

Tencoin enables secure value transfers, timelocks, hashlocks, refundable payments, and secret-based redemption directly at the transaction output level without requiring smart contracts, external execution environments, or trusted intermediaries.

## Introduction

Tencoin is a Proof-of-Work cryptocurrency designed for secure peer-to-peer electronic payments.

The network uses a UTXO-based transaction model and extends traditional transaction functionality through Native Conditional Outputs, allowing spending conditions to be enforced directly by consensus rules.

Unlike account-based smart contract platforms, Tencoin maintains a simple and deterministic validation model while supporting advanced transaction flows.

## Key Features

### Native Conditional Outputs

Tencoin introduces consensus-enforced conditional outputs that allow coins to be spent only when predefined conditions are satisfied.

Supported transaction types include:

* Standard UTXO Transfers
* Timelock Outputs
* Hashlock Outputs
* Refundable Transfers
* Secret-Code Protected Payments

All conditions are validated by every full node and enforced by consensus.

---

### Proof-of-Work Security

Tencoin uses SHA-256 Proof-of-Work consensus.

Blocks are secured through computational work, and the valid chain with the greatest cumulative proof-of-work is considered authoritative by the network.

---

### UTXO-Based Architecture

Tencoin follows the UTXO model pioneered by Bitcoin.

This approach provides:

* Deterministic validation
* Transparent ownership tracking
* Efficient transaction verification
* Simplified payment verification (SPV)

---

### Peer-to-Peer Network

Nodes communicate through a decentralized peer-to-peer network.

The network is designed to operate without central coordination while maintaining consensus through Proof-of-Work.

Mainnet ports:

* P2P: `10110`
* RPC: `10111`

---

### JSON-RPC Interface

Tencoin provides a JSON-RPC interface for:

* Wallet software
* Blockchain explorers
* Monitoring tools
* Application integrations
* Node management

---

## Technical Overview

### Transaction Model

Transactions consume existing UTXOs and create new outputs.

Each output may contain:

* Standard ownership conditions
* Timelock conditions
* Hashlock conditions
* Refund rules
* Additional consensus-supported constraints

Outputs that fail validation requirements cannot be spent.

---

### Consensus Validation

Every fully validating node independently verifies:

* Proof-of-Work
* Block structure
* Transaction validity
* UTXO availability
* Conditional output requirements
* Consensus rules

Invalid blocks are rejected by the network.

---

### Monetary Policy

Tencoin has a fixed maximum supply of:

**10,000,000 TEC**

New coins are introduced through block rewards and distributed to miners.

The block subsidy begins at:

**50 TEC per block**

and is reduced by half every:

**100,000 blocks**

## Development Status

⚠️ Tencoin is currently under active development.

Features, APIs, consensus rules, network behavior, and software components may change between releases until the protocol reaches long-term stability.

The current whitepaper reflects the intended protocol design and may evolve as implementation progresses.
